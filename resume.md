## Summary: I am a web software developer.

I build web applications. I learn quickly. I'm extremely tenacious when it comes to getting things done and figuring things out.  I have experience with high pressure situations that require fast action, precise movements and critical thinking skills. Good software is developed by combining research, planning, quick iterations, testing, and communication.  I build the best product that possible, in the time given. I make sure I have the tools and knowledge required to do so.

Give me a specification, I will do everything in my power to produce a reusable, extensible, fast, and efficient solution; on time, and with a smile.

## Identities and resources

Writing

Published many articles regarding perl, a few of which are listed here:

[Playing With Scala, part 1](http://stonecolddev.in/posts/playing-with-scala-building-a-small-web-app-with-play-2-4-play-slick-and-postgres) and [part 2](http://stonecolddev.in/posts/playing-with-scala-building-a-small-web-app-with-play-2-4-play-slick-and-postgres-part-2-testing) - A tutorial on how to get the Scala version of the Play! framework set up under Postgres specs2 for testing, using travis-ci for continuous integration testing.  It was generally well received on the scala subreddit on reddit.com, and I actually received some email correspondence and comments on the article from the Slick author himself with some advice and praise on the article.
