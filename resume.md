## Summary: I am a web software developer.

I build web applications. I learn quickly. I'm extremely tenacious when it comes to getting things done and figuring things out.  I have experience with high pressure situations that require fast action, precise movements and critical thinking skills. Good software is developed by combining research, planning, quick iterations, testing, and communication.  I build the best product that is possible, in the time given. I make sure I have the tools and knowledge required to do so.

Give me a specification, I will do everything in my power to produce a reusable, extensible, fast, and efficient solution; on time, and with a smile.

### DNA Data Science Platform - Senior Software Engineer
Extracted EC2 orchestration functionality from a Spring Boot application into its own application and extended its functionality

Set up a build system using Jenkins 2 Pipelines to deploy the application to EC2 instances running Docker on CoreOS

Used Terraform to set up all required IAM roles, policies, and other resources (S3 buckets, Aurora clusters, SSM documents)

Handled every aspect of the aforementioned application from designing and implementing both application and infrastructure architecture

Successfully launched beta version of orchestration application to a select group of scientists after overcoming a lot of infrastructure adversity with minimal support

### DNA Platform - Senior Software Engineer
Designed and implemented a Spring Boot Java application to manage provisioning EC2 instances for DNA scientists, saving the team
about 3 months of training and development time.  

Set up a more robust build system for an existing application that helped through numerous deployments and disasters.

Mentored junior and less experienced developers through various application development systems, deployment procedures and coding best practices.  

Built out and configured several build and deploy environments using Jenkins pipelines, EC2, git, Docker and bash.

Wrote a blue/green deployment script in bash to handle deployments in AWS

## August 2012 - October 2016 Ancestry.com

### Devops - Software Developer
Worked on maintaining configuration for DNA application stacks through Chef

Built various data migration scripts, data transformation scripts, and a small Go cron job that handled kicking off recurring billing jobs.

Wrote several tools to handle several large image imports and mysql data migrations for an image service that handled several terabytes of image data

Maintained and added several features to an existing, large, legacy, high traffic image service written in Perl, running on AWS, using MySQL as the metadata backend and S3 for image storage.  

Worked on building a testing framework for a large .NET application using C#, Selenium, Fitnesse and Jenkins.

Managed configuration, build, and deployment for several applications spanning across Linux, Windows and various different application frameworks.  Since there was only a manual process to handle these deployments, I wrote several tools to help make things more stable.

## Identities and resources

Writing

Published many articles regarding perl, a few of which are listed here:

[Playing With Scala, part 1](http://stonecolddev.in/posts/playing-with-scala-building-a-small-web-app-with-play-2-4-play-slick-and-postgres) and [part 2](http://stonecolddev.in/posts/playing-with-scala-building-a-small-web-app-with-play-2-4-play-slick-and-postgres-part-2-testing) - A tutorial on how to get the Scala version of the Play! framework set up under Postgres specs2 for testing, using travis-ci for continuous integration testing.  It was generally well received on the scala subreddit on reddit.com, and I actually received some email correspondence and comments on the article from the Slick author himself with some advice and praise on the article.
