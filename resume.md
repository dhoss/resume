## Summary: I am a web software developer.

I build web applications and have experience with many common frameworks in several different languages, including Java, Go, and Ruby.

I learn very well, and am extremely tenacious when it comes to getting things done and figuring things out.  I've had a good deal of experience with high pressure situations
that require fast action, precise movements, and critical thinking skills in order to get something done, or fixed.  In my experience, good software is developed by combining research, planning, quick and iterative development cycles, testing and communication.  I spend my time making sure I have the information required to build the best product that I can in the time given, and I make sure I have the tools and knowledge to do so.

In summation, give me a specification, and I'm going to do everything in my power to produce a reusable, extensible, fast and efficient solution for you, on time, and with a smile.

## Identities and resources

Writing

Published many articles regarding perl, a few of which are listed here:

[Playing With Scala, part 1](http://stonecolddev.in/posts/playing-with-scala-building-a-small-web-app-with-play-2-4-play-slick-and-postgres) and [part 2](http://stonecolddev.in/posts/playing-with-scala-building-a-small-web-app-with-play-2-4-play-slick-and-postgres-part-2-testing) - A tutorial on how to get the Scala version of the Play! framework set up under Postgres specs2 for testing, using travis-ci for continuous integration testing.  It was generally well received on the scala subreddit on reddit.com, and I actually received some email correspondence and comments on the article from the Slick author himself with some advice and praise on the article.
